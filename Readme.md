This repository includes additional implementations of the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite.

See here for the main repository of the Are-we-fast-yet suite: https://github.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet
See also the ORIGINAL_README.md file in this repository.

Each additional implementation is in a separate subdirectory (e.g. "Cpp" or "Oberon"); see there for more information.

More implementations will follow (currently a Free Pascal version is planned).
